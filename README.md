# REAL-TIME FLOOD PREDICTION USING SVM

## About The Project

The Rainfall and River Level Prediction project aims to predict river levels based on historical rainfall data. This project utilizes a linear regression model to establish a relationship between cumulative rainfall and river levels, providing valuable insights for flood monitoring and prediction.

Key features include:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Linear regression modeling
- Visualization of rainfall and river level data

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

## Results

The project provides valuable insights into the relationship between rainfall and river levels. The linear regression model allows for the prediction of river levels based on cumulative rainfall data. This information can be used for flood monitoring and early warning systems.
